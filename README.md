🛒 B2C Quick Commerce Application (Blinkit-Like)

📌 Overview

This project is a minimal B2C Quick Commerce Application inspired by Blinkit, developed as part of an intern assignment to demonstrate understanding of:
• Microservices architecture
• Backend API development using FastAPI
• Flutter mobile application integration
• Docker containerization
• Kubernetes orchestration
• End-to-end service communication

The application allows users to browse products, add items to cart, place orders, and track delivery status.

🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a Microservices Architecture consisting of four independent backend services and one Flutter frontend.

Flutter App
│
▼
User Service ── Authentication (JWT)
Product Service ── Product Catalog
Cart & Order Service ── Cart + Order Management
Delivery Service ── Order Tracking
│
▼
MongoDB (separate collections per service)

Each microservice:
• Runs independently
• Has its own Dockerfile
• Uses MongoDB collections
• Communicates via REST APIs

🧰 Tech Stack

Backend
• Python
• FastAPI
• MongoDB (Motor Async Driver)
• JWT Authentication
• REST APIs (JSON)

Frontend
• Flutter (Dart)

DevOps
• Docker
• Kubernetes (Local cluster)
• kubectl
• Docker Desktop

🧩 Microservices

⸻

1️⃣ User Service (Port 8001)

Responsibilities
• User registration
• Login authentication
• JWT token generation
• Profile retrieval

APIs
• POST /register
• POST /login
• GET /profile

Stored Data
• User ID
• Name
• Email
• Hashed Password
• Created Timestamp

Authentication uses JWT tokens.

2️⃣ Product Catalog Service (Port 8002)

Responsibilities
• Provide product listings and categories.

APIs
• GET /products
• GET /products/{product_id}
• GET /categories

Products are pre-seeded in MongoDB.

3️⃣ Cart & Order Service (Port 8003)

Responsibilities
• Cart management
• Order creation
• Order history

APIs
• POST /cart/add
• DELETE /cart/remove/{cart_id}
• PUT /cart/increase/{cart_id}
• PUT /cart/decrease/{cart_id}
• GET /cart/{user_id}
• POST /order/create
• GET /orders/{user_id}

Features
• Quantity merge logic
• Increment / decrement cart items
• Automatic cart clearing after order
• Calls Delivery Service after order creation

4️⃣ Delivery & Order Status Service (Port 8004)

Responsibilities
• Simulate delivery lifecycle.

Order Status Flow

PLACED → PACKED → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → DELIVERED

APIs
• GET /order/{order_id}/status
• POST /order/{order_id}/update-status

Order status is automatically initialized when an order is created.

📱 Flutter Application

Implemented Screens
• ✅ Login Screen
• ✅ Signup Screen
• ✅ Home Screen (Products)
• ✅ Cart Screen
• ✅ Order Confirmation
• ✅ Order Tracking Screen

Features
• API integration with all microservices
• Cart quantity controls (+ / −)
• Order placement
• Live order tracking
• Error handling

🐳 Docker Setup

Each microservice includes:
• Dockerfile
• Environment configuration
• Independent container execution

Build example:
docker build -t cart-order-service ./cart-order-service

☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

All services are deployed using Kubernetes manifests.

Deploy services
kubectl apply -f k8s/

Check pods
kubectl get pods

Port forwarding (example)
kubectl port-forward service/cart-order-service 8003:8000

▶️ Running the Application

1. Start Kubernetes cluster

(minikube / docker-desktop Kubernetes)

2. Deploy services
   kubectl apply -f k8s/

3. Port forward services

Service Local Port
User 8001
Product 8002
Cart 8003
Delivery 8004

4. Run Flutter App
   cd quick_commerce_app
   flutter pub get
   flutter run

📦 Database Design

Each service uses isolated collections:

Service Database Collection
User user_db users
Product product_db products
Cart cart_db cart_items
Order cart_db orders
Delivery delivery_db order_status

⚙️ Assumptions
• OTP verification uses a hardcoded value (1234)
• No payment gateway integration
• Internal microservice communication is trusted
• Products are pre-seeded

⚠️ Known Limitations
• No API Gateway
• No distributed logging
• Delivery status updates are manual
• Minimal UI styling (focus on functionality)

🎥 Demo

    •	User registration & login
    •	Product browsing
    •	Cart operations
    •	Order placement
    •	Delivery tracking

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

Run all services locally:

```bash
docker compose up --build

```
